# ⚠️ External Contributions Not Accepted

**Thank you for your interest in loopy-claude!**

However, **this repository does not accept external contributions**. This is a personal research project focused on exploring AI-assisted development patterns with a specific philosophy.

## What Should You Do Instead?

### If This is Your Own Fork
If you're working on your own fork and accidentally opened this PR against the upstream repository:
- Close this PR

### If You Want to Contribute an Improvement
I appreciate the thought, but I'm not accepting PRs. Instead, you can:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create your own variant with your improvements
2. **Share Your Fork**: If your changes are valuable, others can use your fork
3. **Open a Discussion Issue**: Discuss the idea without expecting implementation
4. **Report Bugs**: If this fixes a bug, please [open an issue](https://github.com/tomaslucas/loopy-claude/issues) describing the problem

### If You Found a Security Issue
Please do not open a public PR. Instead:
- Review [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) for reporting guidelines
- Open a security issue describing the vulnerability
- I'll address it as soon as possible

## Why This Policy?

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full explanation. In short:
- Personal learning project with tight creative control
