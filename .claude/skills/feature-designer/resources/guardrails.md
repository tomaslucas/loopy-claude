# Critical Guardrails

## Highest Priority

**🚨 Specs ≠ Code**
- ❌ DO NOT increment VERSION
- ❌ DO NOT update CHANGELOG.md
- ✅ DO update specs/README.md (PIN)

**🔍 Phase 0 is Mandatory**
- Never spec based on assumptions
- Always research first

**🎯 Wait for Explicit Trigger**
- Only crystallize when user says so
- Don't rush to formalize

**📦 Batch Crystallization**
- Create all specs at once
- Update PIN once at end

**🎨 One Topic = One Spec**
- Use "One Sentence Without 'And'" test

**🧪 Non-Goals Are Critical**
- Every spec must have explicit non-goals

**🔗 Coherence is Mandatory**
- All specs must be 100% aligned
- Validate before crystallization
- Block until conflicts resolved

**🔧 Tool Restrictions**
- Read, Write, Grep, Glob, AskUserQuestion ONLY
- No Bash, Edit, or other tools
