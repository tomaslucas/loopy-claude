# Contributing to Loopy-Claude

## No External Contributions Accepted

**This is a personal research project and I am not accepting external contributions at this time.**

This policy exists because:

1. **Personal Learning**: This project is a vehicle for exploring AI-assisted development patterns
2. **Radical Simplicity**: Maintaining the core philosophy requires tight creative control
3. **Minimalist Maintenance**: I want to keep overhead minimal and avoid PR review burden
4. **Experimental Nature**: The project direction may change rapidly based on research findings

## But I Have an Idea!

I appreciate your interest! Here are ways you can engage with loopy-claude:

### Fork and Experiment

Please feel free to:
- Fork the repository and experiment with your own ideas
- Create your own variant with different design choices
- Share your fork with others if you find it useful
- Write blog posts about your experiences

### Report Bugs

If you find a bug, please [open an issue](https://github.com/tomaslucas/loopy-claude/issues) with:
- Clear description of the problem
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Your environment details

I may fix bugs as time permits, but there's no guaranteed timeline.

### Discuss Ideas

Want to discuss the philosophy or approach? Great! You can:
- Open a [feature discussion issue](https://github.com/tomaslucas/loopy-claude/issues/new/choose)
- Share your thoughts on alternative approaches

I'm happy to discuss ideas even if I don't implement them.

### Security Issues

Found a security vulnerability? Please see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for reporting guidelines.

## Why Open Source Then?

Even though I'm not accepting contributions, I believe in:

1. **Transparency**: You can see exactly how it works
2. **Learning**: Others can learn from the code and approach
3. **Forking**: You can adapt it to your needs
4. **Accountability**: Public code encourages better design decisions

## Closing Thoughts

I understand this policy may be disappointing if you wanted to contribute. The decision is about maintaining the project's direction and keeping my overhead minimal, not about the quality of potential contributions.

If this policy ever changes, I'll update this document and announce it in the repository.

Thank you for understanding!
