## Context Budget Summary

| Task | Files | Lines | Budget |
|------|-------|-------|--------|
| Create validate.md | 1 new + 2 reference | ~400 new + ~800 ref | MEDIUM |

Total tasks: 1 (from 1 spec)
Grouping rationale: Spec has two distinct deliverables (new prompt file, shell script integration). Each is self-contained with different verification strategies.
